  For my grid, I chose to analyze the Cambridge Analytica fake social media users that they created during the 2016 election. There are several reasons that this is unethical, and I chose to highlight a few in my grid. The 2016 election faced many difficulties due to online trolling and misinformation, which eroded trust in the system for many people. This trend, unfortunately, continued in to the 2020 election as well. 
  The ethical dilemas that I identified generally fall in to two categories. The first is the broader societal ethical concerns. Stuff like this erodes trust in societal systems. There are serious concerns when people no longer trust that the government can be trusted to carry out elections. For instance, the Capitol raids on January 6th, 2021 were caused because of doubt surrounding the legitimacy of the election. The other set of dilemas were more related to actual computing. Bots like this are an obvious violation of the user agreements on many platforms. Also, the platforms themselves should be more vigilant about stopping these bots on their platforms.
